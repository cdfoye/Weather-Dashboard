<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<h1 align="center"> Project Description</h1>

This project allows a traveler to see the weather outlook for multiple cities in order to plan a trip. When they search for a city, they are presented with the current and future 5 day forecast for the city, and that city is then added to the search history. When they click on a city in the search history, then the user is presented with the current and future 5 day forecast again.
